CREATING THE INVENTORY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 

As a novice with regards to coding in c#, faced with this “problem”, I decided to look up possible solutions online, to see how others approached the problem.

Per the requirements, I gathered certain abstracts for the key users of the inventory management system who are the admin and attendant. These abstract values were used to gain access to the system.

Besides that, I decided to create separate interfaces for the different users. This is because per the requirements, an admin has certain privileges an attendant does not, hence the need for that.

With regards to creating the interfaces , I decided it best to create dashboards for each user depending on what they can do in the system. I added certain functions to the dashboard and connected them to MySQL Server.

The functions on the dashboard for each user , I used sql queries for most of them as those solutions were easier and more appropriate.

Finally,for the ui, research on the internet recommended Bunifu, which was a little limiting because it requires a license to access the full features. But some of the features were available, such as buttons and panels.
